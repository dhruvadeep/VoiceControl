# About Us
We are developing a voice control system where you can control a system from another(or the same system) through voice commands

### Our Experience
We got to know a full SaaS workflow. This was the first time we developed something this big, where coordination between teammates where really done with the help of tools like uv, git, ruff, etc..

Learning Containerisation and Git workflow would be some of the best learnings we might have had from this project.

Even though we added many things as per the requirements, we started without adding many, so it was difficult to incoperate those. But once we started using the tools and structures mentioned in the requirements, we felt the real use of that ... It really made our lives easier later. Taking the example of Yaml and toml files, we were able to easily change the commands without really messing with the code
